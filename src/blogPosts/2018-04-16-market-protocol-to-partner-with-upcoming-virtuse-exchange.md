[MARKET Protocol](http://www.marketprotocol.io/) is pleased to announce a partnership with the upcoming Virtuse Exchange.[Virtuse Group](https://virtusegroup.com/), the parent of VIRTUSE Exchange has a rich and established history in the carbon emissions trading space with over 10 years of experience and 200 million tons traded. As one of the first implementations of MARKET Protocol, we are thrilled to have application partners with deep trading and market making experience. We are excited to see a traditional OTC/derivatives firm utilizing MARKET Protocol as a decentralized back-end for their upcoming exchange application.

Leveraging their experience, VIRTUSE Exchange plans to connect crypto markets with real world assets. First expected to launch in the spring of 2018 with spot traded cryptocurrency pairs and following up with Digital Asset Collateralized Tokens (DACTs) released later in the year.

VIRTUSE Exchange plans to use MARKET Protocol to trustlessly implement a number of DACTs. Through the MARKET Protocol VIRTUSE Exchange can create and trade any digital or non-digital relationship allowing them to offer new products unavailable on traditional exchanges in a safe and solvent framework. As established traders and brokers of real world commodities they can offer their existing traders products specifically designed for their needs.

“We are excited to help the VIRTUSE Exchange team as they implement a solution on MARKET Protocol,” said Seth Rubin, CEO of MARKET Protocol. “This makes a lot of sense for us. MP offers a solution that isn’t available in today’s market allowing us to create DACTs, as well as, manage their liquidity on our platform,” said Ras Vasilisin CEO and founder of VIRTUSE Exchange.
