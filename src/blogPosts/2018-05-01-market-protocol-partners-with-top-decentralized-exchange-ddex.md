[MARKET Protocol](http://www.marketprotocol.io/) is pleased to announce a partnership with[DDEX](http://www.ddex.io/)! As a decentralized exchange, DDEX plans to implement MARKET Protocol alongside their existing spot trading. MARKET Protocol was built to enable buying or selling of derivative relationships in a DEX environment without the need to borrow or take custody of the underlying reference asset. Through derivative exposure DDEX’s users are no longer limited by existing ERC20 to ERC20 relationships and opens the door for expanded on-chain, off-chain and cross-chain offerings all within a safe and solvent trading ecosystem.

DDEX has focused on delivering an easy and intuitive trading experience. Seth Rubin, CEO and co-founder of MARKET Protocol said, “We have watched DDEX do a great job growing their user base and product offerings by simplifying the entire decentralized trading process and look forward to working together.” Bowen Wang co-founder of DDEX mentioned, “MARKET Protocol allows us to provide a range of unique trading relationships within our existing infrastructure. We can create many new trading opportunities for our users they can’t get anywhere else.”
