MARKET Protocol (“MARKET”) provides an opportunity for crypto holders to gain exposure to both real-world and digital assets through derivatives using crypto-based assets as collateral on the Ethereum blockchain.



As an open source protocol governed by its participants, MARKET does not levy any fees or extract value from the system. The protocol provides the interoperability necessary for order routing and other trading activities on the blockchain. By utilizing a shared collateral pool, MARKET introduces a systemically responsible alternative to traditional leverage.



Third party projects can build decentralized applications or “dApps” on top of the protocol, giving the non-technical Trader the ability to easily interact with the underlying blockchain technology. The internal team is preparing to release the first dApp for public beta that allows users to create MARKET contracts and explore previously deployed contracts.



MARKET will provide exposure for Traders to other cross-chain crypto assets without having to manage multiple exchanges or take custody of a separate asset. This means Traders can have similar price exposure to owning a cryptocurrency like Monero or stock like Apple without ever transacting in the asset. Traders will be able to gain long and short exposure to any asset, provided there is sufficient liquidity.



Some of our founding team will be attending EthDenver (https://ethdenver.com/) this weekend and would love to talk more about the project with anyone interested.
