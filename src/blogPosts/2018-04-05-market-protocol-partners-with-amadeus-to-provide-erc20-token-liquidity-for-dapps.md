[MARKET](https://www.marketprotocol.io/) is pleased to announce a partnership with [Amadeus](http://amadeusrelay.org/), a provider of ERC20 token liquidity to existing dApps. Projects will be able to effortlessly exchange tokens allowing them to focus on their core competencies.

Holding token inventory is necessary for Amadeus to provide dApps with consistent liquidity. Amadeus can now decouple the price volatility of their tokens from the business services they provide leveraging MARKET Protocol’s unique smart contracts. This is a great application of deploying derivatives for risk mitigation and helps Amadeus grow their business. As Amadeus manages their token reserves, they will contribute to the overall MARKET ecosystem.

Seth Rubin, CEO of MARKET Protocol commented on the new partnership saying, “We look forward to working with their team as they continue to build and scale Amadeus.” Joao Otavio Barbosa, Strategy Manager at Amadeus, said “MARKET Protocol enables us to effectively manage the price risk of our token reserves and focus on our business.”
