[MARKET Protocol](https://marketprotocol.io/) is pleased to announce a collaboration with [Shark Relay](https://sharkrelay.com/).

As many token traders know, there are limited options to short crypto assets or bet on a price decline. Short selling is a fundamental piece of any efficient market and is very difficult or impossible for many participants. Further, if available, it is centralized and only offers limited products.

Through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, MARKETâ€™s decentralized protocol facilitates risk transference and trustless trading. Traders are not just limited to owned ERC20 tokens. MARKET Protocol contracts allow exposure to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple, and Monero.

Shark Relay launched on the mainnet at the end of April with an easy to use and intuitive dashboard. We look forward to working with Shark Relay as they bring decentralized derivatives to their traders.
